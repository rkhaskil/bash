Context:
During the early phase of the U.S. shift, there was a perception that the team was underutilized. At that time, the shift consisted of four members — two of whom had been with Deutsche Bank less than three months and one who was in the process of transitioning out and contributing minimally. The lack of a structured training program or accessible subject-matter experts during U.S. hours made onboarding challenging, as most issue resolution required independent learning and troubleshooting.

My Contribution:
Despite these constraints, I made every effort to take ownership of assigned tickets, research issues, and resolve problems independently. This helped me rapidly gain familiarity with Deutsche Bank’s cloud environment, internal tools, and escalation pathways. I collaborated closely with the other new U.S. shift engineer, often sharing insights, troubleshooting approaches, and assisting with network-related escalations.

To provide transparency, I consistently submitted detailed daily timesheets outlining my activities and time allocations. After being informed that my initial submissions didn’t align with expectations, I requested clarification and a discussion on the correct format, though I did not receive timely guidance.

Challenges Identified:

Absence of formal training or mentorship for U.S. shift engineers.

Limited communication and feedback loops, resulting in inconsistent expectations.

Perception issues regarding the value of the U.S. shift’s contribution.

Comments suggesting that ticket handling is “beneath” certain roles created ambiguity around task ownership.

Reflection and Next Steps:
I remain committed to demonstrating the value of the U.S. shift by:

Continuing to handle network-related tickets and escalations with ownership and accountability.

Proactively documenting and sharing solutions to build a stronger knowledge base for future U.S. shift engineers.

Maintaining transparent communication on daily deliverables while seeking clearer role definitions and priorities.

Supporting global collaboration and highlighting how 24-hour coverage improves response times and operational resilience.

Summary Statement:
I take pride in contributing to the stabilization of the U.S. shift despite initial challenges. With clearer communication, structured onboarding, and better process alignment, I believe this shift can continue to deliver measurable value to the organization and global SRE operations.

1️⃣ Deutsche Bank Cloud University – Associate Cloud Engineer Program
I’m currently in Week 5 of the program and fully caught up on all assigned modules and labs. I’ve been applying concepts from the curriculum, especially around GCP networking and IAM fundamentals, to real scenarios in our environment. I plan to continue completing each week’s deliverables on schedule and begin preparing for certification once the program concludes.

2️⃣ Cross-Team Collaboration and Network Escalation Support
I’ve been actively participating in daily stand-up meetings for the U.S. shift, providing updates on ongoing issues, highlighting risks, and ensuring visibility across time zones. I’ve also acted as an escalation point for network-related incidents, assisting teammates in troubleshooting and resolution. This has helped build stronger communication channels between the Cloud Reliability, Networking, and Application teams and improved coordination for after-hours coverage.

3️⃣ Ticket Reduction and SLA Maintenance
In September, I resolved approximately 28 network-related issues, contributing directly to improving ticket throughput and supporting SLA compliance. I’ve also been documenting troubleshooting steps and sharing learnings to help newer team members handle similar cases more efficiently. Over time, these efforts are helping to reduce recurring incidents and build a stronger knowledge foundation for the U.S. shift.

Summary / Reflection:
Overall, I’ve made solid progress toward my end-of-year goals. The Cloud University program is on track, collaboration across teams has improved, and network-related ticket handling continues to show measurable results. My next focus will be on expanding documentation for recurring network issues, mentoring newer shift members, and completing the Cloud University certification phase by year-end.

1️⃣ Deutsche Bank Cloud University – Associate Cloud Engineer Program
I’m currently in Week 5 of the program and fully caught up on all assigned modules and labs. I’ve been applying concepts from the curriculum, especially around GCP networking and IAM fundamentals, to real scenarios in our environment. I plan to continue completing each week’s deliverables on schedule and begin preparing for certification once the program concludes.

2️⃣ Cross-Team Collaboration and Network Escalation Support
I’ve been actively participating in daily stand-up meetings for the U.S. shift, providing updates on ongoing issues, highlighting risks, and ensuring visibility across time zones. I’ve also acted as an escalation point for network-related incidents, assisting teammates in troubleshooting and resolution. This has helped build stronger communication channels between the Cloud Reliability, Networking, and Application teams and improved coordination for after-hours coverage.

3️⃣ Ticket Reduction and SLA Maintenance
In September, I resolved approximately 28 network-related issues, contributing directly to improving ticket throughput and supporting SLA compliance. I’ve also been documenting troubleshooting steps and sharing learnings to help newer team members handle similar cases more efficiently. Over time, these efforts are helping to reduce recurring incidents and build a stronger knowledge foundation for the U.S. shift.

Summary / Reflection:
Overall, I’ve made solid progress toward my end-of-year goals. The Cloud University program is on track, collaboration across teams has improved, and network-related ticket handling continues to show measurable results. My next focus will be on expanding documentation for recurring network issues, mentoring newer shift members, and completing the Cloud University certification phase by year-end.

1️⃣ Act Responsibly to Inspire Trust
I take ownership of my work and make sure issues are handled properly the first time. I keep communication open during stand-ups and updates so the team knows what’s being worked on and can rely on consistent follow-through.

2️⃣ Think Commercially for Sustainable Outcomes
I focus on fixing root causes instead of quick workarounds. By documenting common network issues and sharing lessons learned, I help reduce repeat tickets and keep operations running efficiently.

3️⃣ Take Initiative to Create Solutions
With limited support during U.S. hours, I’ve learned to troubleshoot independently and apply what I’m learning from the Cloud University and GCP training. I also contribute to runbooks so newer team members can ramp up faster.

4️⃣ Work Collaboratively for the Greatest Impact
I stay active in daily stand-ups, share updates with global teams, and coordinate on escalations. I make it a point to help others with network-related issues so we can close tickets faster and keep the workflow smooth across shifts.

Find the PSC forwarding rule (global) using that endpoint’s IP

IP=THE_ENDPOINT_IP   # or skip IP and just list all PSC FRs
gcloud compute forwarding-rules aggregated list \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="(IPAddress=$IP) OR (target~'serviceAttachments/') " \
  --format='table(name,scope,IPAddress,loadBalancingScheme,target)'


Delete the forwarding rule (this deletes the PSC endpoint)

# If it showed under "global" scope:
gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete FORWARDING_RULE_NAME \
  --global \
  --project=PROJECT_ID


Delete the static address the FR was using (global or regional—match the FR scope)

# Global example:
gcloud compute addresses delete ADDRESS_NAME --global --project=PROJECT_ID
# Regional example:
gcloud compute addresses delete ADDRESS_NAME --region=REGION --project=PROJECT_ID


After the FR is gone, the Service Directory endpoint that said “non-user-defined” will no longer block your teardown. Note that Service Directory namespaces/services created by PSC are intentionally non-deletable by users; you remove the PSC endpoint instead (you don’t have to delete those SD resources themselves).

Permissions you’ll need

To delete the FR: compute.forwardingRules.delete (in roles like compute.admin or compute.loadBalancerAdmin).

If it’s a PSC endpoint, some orgs also require the PSC-specific delete permission on global FRs.

Deleting the SD endpoint directly would require servicedirectory.endpoints.delete, but in this case it’s not applicable because it’s Google-managed.

If you want, paste the output of:

gcloud compute forwarding-rules aggregated list \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="target~'serviceAttachments/'" \
  --format='table(name,scope,IPAddress,target)'


and I’ll point to the exact delete command (global vs regional) for your entry.

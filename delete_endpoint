Description

I am attempting to delete a subnet in the host VPC project (HOST_PROJECT_ID, region REGION, subnet name SUBNET_NAME).

When I run:

gcloud compute networks subnets delete SUBNET_NAME \
  --region=REGION \
  --project=HOST_PROJECT_ID


I get an error that the subnet is still in use by resources such as:

/projects/HOST_PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/addresses/orphanedresource


The orphanedresource address shows users[] pointing to a forwarding rule / Service Directory endpoint, but the forwarding rule cannot be found (gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe returns resource not found).

Attempts to delete the Service Directory endpoint directly fail with:

endpoints belonging to non-user-defined service cannot be deleted


The associated service project that originally hosted the GKE cluster and PSC endpoint has already been deleted, so I cannot remove the resources from that project.

This appears to be a stale or orphaned reference to a Private Service Connect / Service Directory endpoint that blocks subnet deletion.

Request

Please remove the orphaned forwarding rule / Service Directory endpoint reference so that I can delete the subnet in the host VPC project.

Details:

Host Project ID: HOST_PROJECT_ID

Subnet name: SUBNET_NAME

Region: REGION

Orphaned address resource: orphanedresource

Error message when deleting subnet: (include full error text from your CLI)

✅ This makes it very clear: you’ve already done the normal cleanup (clusters, FRs, addresses) but you’re hitting an undeletable Google-managed Service Directory object due to a deleted service project.

Do you want me to also draft a shorter “executive summary” version (2–3 sentences) you can paste into the case description field, so support engineers get the gist immediately?
